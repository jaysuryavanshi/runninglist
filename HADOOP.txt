HADOOP

Core - 

HDFS - Distributed storage file system
YARN - Yet Another Resource Negotiator, Resource allocation
MapReduce - Programming Model to process data across cluster
	Mapper - transform data in parallel across cluster
	Reducer - Aggregate data 
PIG - Sits on top of MapReduce. Scripting way Highlevel programming SQL LIKE API's to
HIVE -  Sits on top of MapReduce. treat HDFS as SQL Database
AMBARI - Portal to administrator the cluster. Horton works on Ambari

MESOS - Similar to YARN
SPARK - Sits on top of MapReduce. Write program using Python
TEZ - Similar to SPARK work in conjuction with HIVE

HBASE - NoSQL Database, Appropriate for transactional data. OLTP.

STORM - Process streaming data, realtime data processing

Ozzie - Jobs scheduler 

Zookeeper - Cluster coordinator, checks nodes availability

Data Ingestion - SQOOP, FLUME, KAFKA

SQOOP - Connector between SQL database and HADOOP cluster.
FLUME - Listen to Weblogs coming from Web server and Publish them to HADOOP Cluster.
KAFKA - Similar to FLUME

Query Engines

DRILL - Query execution engine, Write SQL queries to query across NoSQL database HBASE, HIVE & MongoDB
HUE - - Query execution engine, works closely with AMBARI
PHOENIX - - Query execution engine, Similar to DRILL
Presto - Query execution engine
ZEPPELIN - Query execution engine,


External Data Storage

MySQL and Cassandra- SQL database
MongoDB	 - NoSQL Database
